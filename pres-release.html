                    Dubai, UAE: <a href="/">  IEC Telecom </a>took the lead in accelerating maritime digitalisation in
                    the GCC at the
                    Emirates
                    Shipping Congress, held on the opening day of UAE Maritime Week and organised by Emirates Shipping
                    Association. A leading international satcom solutions provider co-curated a high-impact session in
                    collaboration with the Association to spotlight the latest advancements in marine communications.

                    The UAE’s 2030 vision for digital transformation in the maritime industry includes technologies such
                    as
                    IoT, big data analytics, AI and real-time fleet management, with satellite telecommunication being
                    the
                    backbone of this process. In this evolving landscape, the effective management of onboard network
                    assets
                    has become increasingly critical.

                    “Connectivity is no longer a luxury but a fundamental utility, driving a new era of maritime
                    innovation,” stated Nabil Ben Soussia, Group Chief Commercial Officer at IEC Telecom, addressing
                    delegates of the Emirates Shipping Congress at “Navigating the Digital Seas: Maritime Transformation
                    Powered by Satcom” panel discussion.

                    With high-speed LEO technology—pioneered by Starlink—the latest digital technologies are becoming
                    increasingly available on board. According to the 2024 progress report, 75,000 vessels were
                    connected to
                    the network last year and this number continues to soar. That said, maritime connectivity is very
                    complex and is subject to service availability, weather conditions and local regulations.

                    “No single vessel operates over a single network, particularly in the GCC. Typically, vessels would
                    leverage LEO for international shipping routes, regional GEO operators for internal waters and GSM
                    close
                    to the shore. Each network has different access protocols and a range of applications, adapted to
                    different bandwidths,” explained Nabil Ben Soussia, Group CCO, IEC Telecom Group.
